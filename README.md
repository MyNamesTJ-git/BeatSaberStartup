# BeatSaberStartup
This will help you install and mod your Beat Saber, This page is made by TJ, uses of other sources will be placed into my [Sources](sources.md) page once i rework the instructions. The page will also gain improved instruction with better detail and photo guides once its reworked. Please be patient as I am a colleg student and dont currently have the time to make this page. I may eventually make modpacks (similar to iPixelGalaxy) though this is **not** a guarantee.


## Windows:
### Get Beat Saber:
* Steam:
  * go to Steam and install the game ([Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/))
    *  You do not need to install the game through steam, you will install it in BSManager, You simply need to own the game.
* Meta/Oculus:
  * Go to Meta and install the game in Meta Quest Link ([Meta Link](https://www.meta.com/search/?query=beat+saber))

### Get BSManager:
  * Install BSManager at Zagrios's page: [Link](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager)
    * Launch the setup file and install BS manager, then open the app
  * Select your version
    * Steam (Easy but redundant)
      * Select steam and sign into steam, this is to prevent piracy of beat saber
      * You will have to select steam and log into steam everytime you install a edition of beat saber
      * you will see your steam install as an option, you are able to mod your steam installation
    * Meta (Diffucult but permenant)
      * Select Oculus Store and follow these steps on Zagrios's Wiki [Link](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager/wiki/How-to-obtain-your-Oculus-Token)
      * add your token and save it, again this is to prevent piracy
      * this will NOT need to be repeated for future installs
  ### Install Beat Saber through BSManager:
  * Go to the "Download a version" Page if your not there already, you can navigate to it with the **`+`** icon
  * Select a version, I recommend 1.39.1, but you can go to the recommended version
  * install your version and navigate to it on the side pannel. It will be names with the version you selected until you rename it
  * Go to the mods page and select what mods you want, each mod will have its title, description and version. if the version is red, it means you currently have a outdated version
  * hit the install/update button and launch the game
  ### Install mods via iPixelGalaxy's Mod Pack (Modpack is EOL, Recommended for 1.39.1):
  * Go to iPixelGalaxy's Mod Pack GitHub: [Link](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/iPixelGalaxyBeatSaberModpack/releases)
  * Choose the pack that matches your installed version and install the `BeatSaberModpack####.zip` file
  * Go to BSManager and select your version, Click the gear icon and when the menu appears click the **Open Folder** button
  * *(optional)* open another window of your file manager and place it side by side to your game files
  * open a folder from the Modpack and place its files in the corosponding folder in your game files
  * When you are prompted to "replace existing files" I reccomend **NOT** replacing your files as it will overwrite personal settings. this is only recommended if this is your first time ever modding beatsaber
  * *(optional)* when you finish open the `IPA.exe` This refreshes the modloader
  * When you finish, exit your file manager and navigate to BSManager, From here you should be able to launch the game and start playing or customizing settings.

## Meta/Oculus Quest 2/3/3s (requires PC/Android with a Chromium browser)
### Enable Developer Mode on your Oculus/Meta headset (Skip if you already have Developer Mode)
*I will not currently provide instruction for enabling developer mode at this point. I will in the future, for now query the instructions then come back to this page, This is the official developer mode guide: [link](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/?locale=en_GB)*
### Modding Beat Saber with ModsBeforeFriday! (Via USB ADB)
 * *(You **need** a USB-C cable to use MBF)* First, go to the MBF website on your external browser-capible device.
 * Make sure your headset is on, then plug the headset and computer together and click the "Connect To Quest" button on MBF
 * you will be prompted with a "lauriethefish.github.io wants to connect" dialog, Select your connected quest and click connect.
 * Read the information it desplays carefully, thed click "Mod the app"
 * It will begin downgrading and injecting mods into your game. this will take multiple minutes. **DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR DEVICE**
 * when it finishes, you will be ready to install mods.
 * you will have a [list](https://mods.bsquest.xyz/1.40.8_7379/) of mods to install, select the "Add mods" button to install the core mods and any additional mods you wish to have.
 * You will then manage your Custom songs through Beat Saber. you have the ability to add additional qmods, sabers (i think) and songs through MBF. *(There should be a way to access the MBF mod manager through the quest, i will research how to accesss it at a later date)*
 * Launch beat saber through your headset and your ready to start playing or configuring.
