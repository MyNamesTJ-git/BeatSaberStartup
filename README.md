## Windows:
### Get Beat Saber:
* Steam:
  * go to Steam and install the game ([Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/))
    *  You do not need to install the game through steam, you will install it in BSManager, You simply need to own the game.
* Meta/Oculus:
  * Go to Meta and install the game in Meta Quest Link ([Meta Link](https://www.meta.com/search/?query=beat+saber))

### Get BSManager:
  * Install BSManager at Zagrios's page: [Link](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager)
    * Launch the setup file and install BS manager, then open the app
  * Select your version
    * Steam (Easy but redundant)
      * Select steam and sign into steam, this is to prevent piracy of beat saber
      * You will have to select steam and log into steam everytime you install a edition of beat saber
      * you will see your steam install as an option, you are able to mod your steam installation
    * Meta (Diffucult but permenant)
      * Select Oculus Store and follow these steps on Zagrios's Wiki [Link](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager/wiki/How-to-obtain-your-Oculus-Token)
      * add your token and save it, again this is to prevent piracy
      * this will NOT need to be repeated for future installs
  ### Install Beat Saber through BSManager:
  * Go to the "Download a version" Page if your not there already, you can navigate to it with the **`+`** icon
  * Select a version, I recommend 1.39.1, but you can go to the recommended version
  * install your version and navigate to it on the side pannel. It will be names with the version you selected until you rename it
  * Go to the mods page and select what mods you want, each mod will have its title, description and version. if the version is red, it means you currently have a outdated version
  * hit the install/update button and launch the game
  ### Install mods via iPixelGalaxy's Mod Pack (Modpack is EOL, Recommended for 1.39.1):
  * Go to iPixelGalaxy's Mod Pack GitHub: [Link](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/iPixelGalaxyBeatSaberModpack/releases)
  * Choose the pack that matches your installed version and install the `BeatSaberModpack####.zip` file
  * Go to BSManager and select your version, Click the gear icon and when the menu appears click the **Open Folder** button
  * *(optional)* open another window of your file manager and place it side by side to your game files
  * open a folder from the Modpack and place its files in the corosponding folder in your game files
  * When you are prompted to "replace existing files" I reccomend **NOT** replacing your files as it will overwrite personal settings. this is only recommended if this is your first time ever modding beatsaber
  * *(optional)* when you finish open the `IPA.exe` This refreshes the modloader
  * When you finish, exit your file manager and navigate to BSManager, From here you should be able to launch the game and start playing or customizing settings.

## Meta/Oculus Quest 2/3/3s
